# A simple script to keep a tidy ~/code directory organized by owner & then repo
# When the script is done, just hit command-v to switch into the directory
# (Github and Mac only. Sorry, openness!)
#
# Usage:
#   clone <org>/<repo>
# Or:
#   clone <org> <repo>
#
# example: clone testdouble/testdouble.js
#
# Once cloned, will copy a "cd" command to quickly change into repo directory
